              <p>Leads are the gateway to new patients and growing production, but it is difficult for your team to provide patient care and attend to leads in a timely and systematic fashion simultaneously. Our lead nurturing team expertly handles your leads, guides them thoroughly, and schedules appointments. This ensures a positive patient flow, an increase in production, and overall success.</p>

              <p>Retained patients contribute more to your dental practice's growth since they already know you, and you know them.

On the other hand, our reactivation service brings back those valuable patients who have been missing your care. Overall, this service is a time-saving, economical, and high-production-yielding addition that adds a significant amount of value to your practice revenue.</p>
